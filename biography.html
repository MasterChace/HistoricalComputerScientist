        <div class = "bio-text">After the war was over, Alan Turing was recruited
            by the NPL (National Physical Labratory) to create an electronic
            computer. He designed a computer that was digital and vastly
            superior to all the others at the time, known as the Automatic Computing
            Engine. His colleagues thought the engineering was too complicated, so 
            they designed a smaller version called the "Pilot Model Ace"(See Picture 1).
            He then took up a job at the Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester 
            as a director. There he worked on theoretical ideas and designed computers, (See Picture 2). 
            Then, he designed the first programming manual and his programming system was used
            in the Ferranti Mark 1 Computer. (See Picture 3).
