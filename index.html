                    Throughout Alan Turing's life he managed to have many amazing accomplishments. He originally had got a
degree in mathematics and then found a job as a codebreaker working for the British government. This is
where he got the idea for his machine that would eventually break the German enigma. The breaking of Enigma
gave the Allies a upperhand against the Axis which would save tens, hundreds of thousands, or more lives.
After his career working with the British government, he began designing many computers for different
companies. Eventually he began to be a pioneer for Artificial Intelligence as some of his work on it is still
studied today. He is now the face of the British 50p.
